                Dear Vinci,

                I think that if you let me,
                I'd treat you like the sky.
                I'd join up all your insecurities,
                bundle all your flaws
                into a new constellation,
                and search for it endlessly.
                I know you don't see yourself
                the way i see you
                and you still argue
                when i call you beautiful.
                But all the things you can't stand
                about yourself
                are all the things I can't
                go a day without.
                I think if you let me,
                I'd build an observatory
                just to show youthat all the stars in the universe
                will never shine as brightly 
                as you.
