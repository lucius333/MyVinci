                Dear Vinci,

                As we're getting closer to our 2 week anniversary,
                I'd like to say somethings...

                If i were to build a house
                I'd have your arms as the walls
                Your eyes as the windows
                Your smile as the front door
                Your heart as the fireplace
                And your soul as my light
                And in this house
                I'd place my faith
                Knowing I'd finally 
                Found a home.

                I'd aswell like to thank you my love
                Because of you
                I learned to love
                the most important parts of me,
                because you did.

                All my fear,anxieties,
                quirks,and insecurities.

                I overcame the struggle
                because you held out
                your hand and 
                offered to walk with me.

                I spoke to the moon
                and told her 
                about your face 
                lighting up under
                her gentle beams.

                That moment, I realised
                I loved you.
                In front of her,
                and her sky full of stars.

                She smiled at my story,
                for the moon loved love
                and our love,
                was her favourite.



                Luci 
            
                <!--Dear Vinci,

                I think that if you let me,
                I'd treat you like the sky.
                I'd join up all your insecurities,
                bundle all your flaws
                into a new constellation,
                and search for it endlessly.
                I know you don't see yourself
                the way i see you
                and you still argue
                when i call you beautiful.
                But all the things you can't stand
                about yourself
                are all the things I can't
                go a day without.
                I think if you let me,
                I'd build an observatory
                just to show youthat all the stars in the universe
                will never shine as brightly 
                as you.-->
